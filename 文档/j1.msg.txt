Soon you will be contacted by a hacking group known as CyberSec. They can help you with your search.

You should join them, garner their favor, and exploit them for their Augmentations. But do not trust them. They are not what they seem. No one is.

很快就会有一个名为CyberSec的黑客组织与你联系。 他们可以帮助你寻找。

你应该加入他们，获得他们的青睐，并利用他们的增援。但不要相信他们。他们并不像他们看起来那样。没有人是。
