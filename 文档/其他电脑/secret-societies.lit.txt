Secret Societies

The idea of secret societies has long intrigued the general public by inspiring curiosity, fascination, and distrust. People have long wondered about who these secret society members are and what they do, with the most radical of conspiracy theorists claiming that they control everything in the entire world. And while the world may never know for sure, it is likely that many secret societies do actually exist, even today.

However, the secret societies of the modern world are nothing like those that (supposedly) existed decades and centuries ago. The Freemasons, Knights Templar, and Illuminati, while they may have been around at the turn of the 21st century, almost assuredly do not exist today. The dominance of the Web in our everyday lives and the fact that so much of the world is now digital has given rise to a new breed of secret societies: Internet-based ones.

Commonly called 'hacker groups', Internet-based secret societies have become well-known in today's world. Some of these, such as The Black Hand, are black hat groups that claim they are trying to help the oppressed by attacking the elite and powerful. Others, such as NiteSec, are hacktivist groups that try to push political and social agendas. Perhaps the most intriguing hacker group is the mysterious Bitrunners, whose purpose still remains unknown.

秘密社团

长期以来，秘密社团的概念一直通过激发人们的好奇心、迷恋和不信任来吸引普通大众。人们长期以来一直想知道这些秘密社团成员是谁，他们做什么，最激进的阴谋论者声称他们控制了整个世界的一切。虽然世界可能永远无法确定，但很可能许多秘密社团确实存在，即使在今天也是如此。

然而，现代世界的秘密社团与那些（据说）几十年前和几百年前的秘密社团完全不同。共济会、圣殿骑士团和光明会，虽然在21世纪之交可能还存在，但几乎可以肯定的是今天已经不存在了。网络在我们日常生活中的主导地位，以及世界上如此多的东西现在都是数字化的事实，催生了一种新的秘密社团。基于互联网的秘密组织。

基于互联网的秘密组织通常被称为 "黑客组织"，在今天的世界上已经变得众所周知。其中一些组织，如 "黑手"，是黑帽组织，声称他们试图通过攻击精英和权贵来帮助被压迫的人。其他人，如NiteSec，是试图推动政治和社会议程的黑客组织。也许最吸引人的黑客组织是神秘的Bitrunners，其目的仍然不明。
