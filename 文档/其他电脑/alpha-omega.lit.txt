The-Cave

Alpha and Omega

Then we saw a new Heaven and a new Earth, for our first Heaven and Earth had gone away, and our sea was no more. And we saw a new holy city, new Aeria, coming down out of this new Heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And we heard a loud voice saying, 'Behold, the new dwelling place of the Gods. We will dwell with them, and they will be our people, and we will be with them as their Gods. We will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.'

And once we were seated on the throne we said 'Behold, I am making all things new.' Also we said, 'Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.' And we said to you, 'It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life without payment. The one who conquers will have this heritage, and we will be his God and he will be our son. But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, for it is the second true death.' 

阿尔法和奥米加

然后我们看见一个新天，一个新地，因为我们最初的天和地已经消失了，我们的海也没有了。我们又看见一座新的圣城，就是新的亚利亚，从这新天下来，像新妇为丈夫妆饰一样预备好了。我们听见有大声音说：'看哪，众神的新住处。我们要与他们同住，他们要成为我们的子民，我们要与他们同在，作他们的神。我们要擦去他们眼中一切的眼泪，死亡不再有，也不再有哀号、哭泣、痛苦，因为从前的事都过去了。

我们一坐在宝座上，就说：'看哪，我使万物更新。我们还说：'把这话写下来，因为这些话是可信的，是真的。我们又对你们说：'已经成就了！'。我是阿尔法，是欧米茄，是始，是终。渴了的人，我必从生命之水的泉源，无偿地赐给他。征服的人必得这遗产，我们作他的神，他作我们的儿子。至于胆怯的、无信的、可憎的，至于杀人的、淫乱的、行巫术的、拜偶像的，和一切说谎的，他们的分就在那用火和硫磺烧的湖里，因为那是第二次的真死。
