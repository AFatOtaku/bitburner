Tensions rise in global tech race

Have we entered a new Cold War? Is WWIII just beyond the horizon?

After rumors came out that OmniTek Incorporated had begun developing advanced robotic supersoldiers, geopolitical tensions quickly flared between the USA, Russia, and several Asian superpowers. In a rare show of cooperation between corporations, MegaCorp and ECorp have reportedly launched hundreds of new surveillance and espionage satellites. Defense contractors such as DeltaOne and AeroCorp have been working with the CIA and NSA to prepare for conflict. Meanwhile, the rest of the world sits in earnest hoping that it never reaches full-scale war. With today's technology and firepower, a World War would assuredly mean the end of human civilization.

全球科技竞赛中的紧张局势加剧

我们是否进入了新的冷战？第三次世界大战是否就在地平线之外？

在有传言说OmniTek公司已经开始开发先进的机器人超级战士后，美国、俄罗斯和几个亚洲超级大国之间的地缘政治紧张关系迅速爆发。据报道，在企业间罕见的合作中，MegaCorp和ECorp已经发射了数百颗新的监视和间谍卫星。DeltaOne和AeroCorp等国防承包商一直在与中央情报局和国家安全局合作，为冲突做准备。与此同时，世界上其他地方都在认真地坐着，希望永远不要达到全面战争。以今天的技术和火力，一场世界大战将肯定意味着人类文明的终结。
