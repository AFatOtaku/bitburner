Figures Show Rising Crime Rates in Sector-12

A recent study by analytics company Wilson Inc. shows a significant rise in criminal activity in Sector-12. Perhaps the most alarming part of the statistic is that most of the rise is in violent crime such as homicide and assault. According to the study, the city saw a total of 21,406 reported homicides in 2076, which is over a 20% increase compared to 2075.

CIA director David Glarow says its too early to know whether these figures indicate the beginning of a sustained increase in crime rates, or whether the year was just an unfortunate outlier. He states that many intelligence and law enforcement agents have noticed an increase in organized crime activites, and believes that these figures may be the result of an uprising from criminal organizations such as The Syndicate or the Slum Snakes.

数字显示12区犯罪率上升

分析公司Wilson Inc.最近的一项研究显示，第12区的犯罪活动明显上升。也许这个统计数字中最令人震惊的部分是，大部分的上升是在暴力犯罪方面，如杀人和袭击。根据这项研究，该市在2076年共发生了21,406起报告的凶杀案，与2075年相比增加了20%以上。

中央情报局局长大卫-格拉罗说，现在知道这些数字是否表明犯罪率开始持续上升还为时过早，或者这一年只是一个不幸的例外。他说，许多情报和执法人员已经注意到有组织犯罪活动的增加，并认为这些数字可能是辛迪加或贫民窟之蛇等犯罪组织起义的结果。
