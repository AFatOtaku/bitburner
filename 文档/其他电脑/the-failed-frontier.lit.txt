Space: The Failed Frontier

Humans have long dreamed about spaceflight. With enduring interest, we were driven to explore the unknown and discover new worlds. We dreamed about conquering the stars. And in our quest, we pushed the boundaries of our scientific limits, and then pushed further. Space exploration lead to the development of many important technologies and new industries.

But sometime in the middle of the 21st century, all of that changed. Humanity lost its ambitions and aspirations of exploring the cosmos. The once-large funding for agencies like NASA and the European Space Agency gradually whittled away until their eventual disbanding in the 2060's. Not even militaries are fielding flights into space nowadays. The only remnants of the once great mission for cosmic conquest are the countless satellites in near-earth orbit, used for communications, espionage, and other corporate interests.

And as we continue to look at the state of space technology, it becomes more and more apparent that we will never return to that golden age of space exploration, that age where everyone dreamed of going beyond earth for the sake of discovery.

空间。失败的前沿阵地

人类长期以来一直梦想着太空飞行。带着持久的兴趣，我们被驱使去探索未知的世界，发现新的世界。我们梦想着征服星空。在我们的探索中，我们突破了我们的科学极限，然后又进一步推进。太空探索导致了许多重要技术和新产业的发展。

但在21世纪中期的某个时候，这一切都改变了。人类失去了探索宇宙的雄心和抱负。像美国国家航空航天局和欧洲航天局这样的机构曾经的大量资金逐渐减少，直到2060年代最终解散。如今，甚至连军队都不在向太空进行飞行了。曾经伟大的宇宙征服任务的唯一遗留物是近地轨道上的无数卫星，用于通信、间谍活动和其他企业利益。

当我们继续审视空间技术的状况时，越来越明显的是，我们将永远不会回到那个空间探索的黄金时代，那个人人都梦想着为了发现而超越地球的时代。
