People say that the corrupted governments and corporations rule the world. Yes, maybe they do. But do you know who everyone really fears? People like us. Because they can't hide from us. Because they can't fight shadows and ideas with bullets.

Join us, and people will fear you, too.

Find and install the backdoor on our server. Then, we will contact you again.

人们说，腐败的政府和公司统治着世界。是的，也许他们确实如此。但你知道大家真正害怕的是谁吗？像我们这样的人。因为他们无法躲避我们。因为他们不能用子弹来对抗阴影和思想。

加入我们，人们也会害怕你。

找到并安装我们服务器上的后门。然后，我们会再次联系你。
